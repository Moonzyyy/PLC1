Let (t1:Tile) = Read "ex4Tile1.tl" In
Let (t2:Tile) = Read "ex4Tile2.tl" In
Let (t3:Tile) = Read "ex4Tile3.tl" In
Let (right:Tile) = t1 And (Not t3) In
Let (left:Tile) = t2 And (Not t3) In
Let (size:Int) = (Size t1) * 50 In  -- as a tile is unit size, and there are 50 tiles in the row
Let (half:Int) = size / 2 In
Let (tile:Tile) = Blank size In

Output right
